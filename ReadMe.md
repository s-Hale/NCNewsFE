The front-end section, built with React and styled with CSS and Flexbox, of a news website where users can browse a series of articles and narrow the selection down by topic. Users can add comments to articles, and delete their own, plus they have the ability to vote up or down on articles or comments.

The app is responsive and should render well on mobile and tablet.
